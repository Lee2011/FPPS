  /*
   * Tail Recursion:
   *   Implementation Consideration: If a function calls itself as its last action, the functionâ€™s stack frame can be reused.
   *   This is called tail recursion.
   *
   * Tail recursive functions are iterative processes.
   *
   * In general, if the last action of a function consists of calling a function (which may be the same), one stack frame would
   * be sufficient for both functions. Such calls are called tail-calls.
   *
   * In Scala, only directly recursive calls to the current function are optimized.
   * One can require that a function is tail-recursive using a @tailrec annotation:
   *   @tailrec
   *   def gcd(a: Int, b: Int): Int = ...
   *
   * If the annotation is given, and the implementation of gcd were not tail recursive, an error would be issued.
